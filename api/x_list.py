Leading up to the golive, their agency "Haus", had added domains to the dev/test/staging envs in Atlas (e.g. dev.madeinhaus.com). During go-live they added the LB domains (e.g. dev.leoburnett.com) to Atlas and configured their DNS (different NS than madeinhaus.com). CloudFlare gave consistent 1001 errors no matter what. They had A Record IPs on leoburnett.com and CNAME records to js.wpenginepowered.com for dev/staging/www. We got on a call with their DNS guy and we was pro and had dome everything correctly. Due to some previous experience we\'d seen with Android Authority and Atlas we suggest they try [hash].js.wpenginepowered.com . This did not resolve any issues. Note: both the [hash].js.wpenginepowered.com  and the [env].madeinhaus.com records were working and the site rendered correctly this entire time. It was only the [env].leoburnett.com addresses that were getting the 1001  from CF. WE even tried pointing dev.leoburnett.com to the dev-lb.madeinhaus.com to see if that worked, it did not.\n\nAs a last ditch effort we deleted all domains from the dev env in Atlas; then, we added back ONLY the dev.leoburnett.com.

Click here to request a meeting!\n\nWhat do you need to know now?\n• Since we are coming up to the end of the 2019 / 2020 plan year, now is the time to submit any outstanding outpatient claims or ‘day to day’ expenses to Vhi or DeCare so you can claim for the current policy year.\xa0 For Health Insurance, the easiest way to do this is online - through VHI’s Snap & Send facility (available on the VHI App).\xa0 For dental insurance, you can claim online at the following link (simply go to the online claiming tab and follow the instructions) WP Engine | DeCare Dental Health Hub . You may be able to claim tax relief on any medical and/or dental expenses not covered by your health insurance policy. This is not tax advice but for information purposes only.\xa0 Please refer to www.revenue.ie or contact your local tax office with questions.\xa0\xa0\n\n• Check your calendar invites for details! We will be hosting two benefit presentations and one dedicated EAP session (Employee Assistance Program).  Please note that the two benefit sessions will be the same. We encourage you to attend one benefit session\xa0 which will cover health, dental, pension, risk benefits and additional benefits we are launching! A recording of the benefit and EAP session will be made available.\xa0\n\nFor any questions regarding your claims, you can contact Vhi or DeCare directly:\n• Vhi - 056 777 5800 and is available from 8am – 7pm Monday – Friday and 9am – 3pm on Saturdays.\xa0\xa0\n• DeCare - 1890 130 017 or +353(0)94 93 78608\n\nCan't wait to see y'all (via zoom) next week!
